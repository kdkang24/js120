this refers to the current execution context while the method is running

For function invocations, the implicit function execution context is the global object

For method invocations, the implicit function execution context is the calling object

The function methods call and apply allow us to EXPLICITLY set the function execution context
The bind method returns a new function that permanently binds a function to a context.

Function invocations (e.g., parseInt(numberString)) rely upon implicit execution context that resolves to the global object. 
Method invocations (e.g., array.forEach(processElement)) rely upon implicit context that resolves to the object that holds the method.

Arrow functions are permanently bound to the execution context of the enclosing function invocation.
When defined at the top level, the context of an arrow function is the global object.


ENCAPSULATION
The grouping together of related data and functions is whatâ€™s called encapsulation 
and is one of the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming.

CONSTRUCTORS
When you call a function with new, its implicit context is the new object.
